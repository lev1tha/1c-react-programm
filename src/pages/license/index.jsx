            Accounting of inventories For the organization of accounting of
            inventories, the following methods of valuation of inventories at
            their disposal are supported: <br />
            at average cost; at the cost of first-in-time acquisition of
            inventories (FIFO method). To support the FIFO method of valuation,
            batch accounting is maintained in inventory accounts. Different
            costing methods may be used for different inventory accounts
            (according to IAS 2). <br />
            <br />
            Warehouse accounting Warehouses may have quantitative or
            quantity-accounting. In the first case, the valuation of goods and
            materials does not depend on the warehouse from which they are
            received. Warehouse accounting can be disabled if there is no need
            for it. <br />
            <br />
            In "1C:Accounting 8 for Kyrgyzstan" inventory data are recorded,
            which are automatically reconciled with the accounting data. On the
            basis of the inventory is reflected the identification of surpluses
            and write-off of shortages.
            <br />
            <br />
            Accounting of trade operations Accounting of operations of receipt
            and sale of goods and services is automated. When selling goods,
            invoices for payment are issued, delivery notes and invoices are
            issued. All wholesale trade operations are accounted for in the
            context of contracts with buyers and suppliers. Reflection of
            returns of goods from the buyer and the supplier is automated.
